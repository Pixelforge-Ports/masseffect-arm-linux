/*
 * Mass Effect Infiltrator loader — entry point.
 *
 * This file used to be a NativeActivity driver: open an APK, map the
 * game's .so out of it, build an ANativeActivity and hand it to
 * ANativeActivity_onCreate, then watch the engine run its own frame loop.
 *
 * None of that applies here, and the run log said so in one line:
 *
 *     FATAL: cannot open APK '/game': Operation not supported
 *
 * because the harness passes a *directory*. That error is only the surface of
 * it. Mass Effect Infiltrator is not a NativeActivity game at all:
 *
 *   - it has no DT_NEEDED on libandroid.so and exports no
 *     ANativeActivity_onCreate; its DT_NEEDED list is exactly
 *     libc / libstdc++ / libm / liblog / libGLESv1_CM
 *   - it exports JNI_OnLoad plus 68 Java_* entry points and expects a Java
 *     layer to call them, frame by frame. That layer is this file.
 *   - EA shipped it with the assets outside the package; what circulates is
 *     the extracted tree, so there is no zip to open in the first place.
 *
 * So the driver is inverted with respect to the other two ports: *we* own the
 * frame loop and call into the engine, instead of feeding lifecycle commands
 * to an engine that owns its own.
 *
 * The call order below is not deduced from the symbol names - it is copied
 * from masseffect_main() in the Vita port (vita-ref/loader/main.c, MIT), which
 * runs this exact build. Two of its choices are worth naming because the
 * obvious alternative is wrong:
 *
 *   - the entry point is NativeOnCreate. The .so also exports runEntryPoint,
 *     which reads like the real one; the working port never calls it.
 *   - NativeOnSurfaceChanged is never called either. The renderer takes its
 *     resolution once, at surface-created time.

 * Make the back buffer's contents undefined after a swap, if the driver was

 * nothing puts back what was underneath. That is only invisible while the game
 * repaints the whole screen every frame. It does: with MASSEFFECT_CURSOR_DIAG=1
 * the probe reports `glClear mask=0x4000 colour=yes scissor=off box=0,0 640x480`
 * on every frame of the title screen.
 *
 * So a trail of cursors means the frame that comes back from the swap chain is
 * not blank - the driver handed back a buffer with an older frame still in it,
 * and the game's clear happens per frame, not per buffer. EGL calls that
 * EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED, and it is a per-surface attribute with no portable
 * default: Mesa hands back a destroyed buffer, several Mali drivers preserve.
 * That is exactly the shape of "reproduces on the console, never under the
 * emulator".
 *
 * This queries the real value and only changes it when it is PRESERVED, so on a
 * driver that already destroys (the emulator) it does nothing at all. Both the
 * before and after values are traced, which is the evidence for whether this
 * was the cause - if the console reports DESTROYED to begin with, the theory is
 * wrong and the log says so without needing another trip.
 *
 * MASSEFFECT_CURSOR_RESTORE=0 leaves the surface alone. Worth keeping, because
 * a preserved back buffer is a legitimate thing for an engine to rely on: if
 * this build ever drew incrementally, destroying the buffer would break it, and
 * that would show up as a flickering or half-drawn frame rather than a trail.
