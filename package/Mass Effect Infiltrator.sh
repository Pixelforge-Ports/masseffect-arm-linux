# SDL must create its context through the device's own 32-bit GL stack. Build
# symlinks in /tmp because the SD card may be exFAT and cannot preserve them.
#
# Which stack that is depends on the device, not on the firmware's name, so it
# is found by capability:
#
#   1. A unified Mali blob under one of the exact tested filenames - one .so
#      exporting EGL, GLESv1_CM and GLESv2, linked to every name the game asks
#      for. Known-good and therefore first.
#   2. A split Mali wrapper set - a directory holding both libEGL.so and
#      libGLESv2.so, the layout a Batocera-derived firmware installs. SDL is
#      pointed straight at those two files (SDL_VIDEO_EGL_DRIVER /
#      SDL_VIDEO_GL_DRIVER) rather than being left to find a blob.
#   3. Any other Mali blob in the 32-bit library directories, because every
#      distribution names it differently: versioned upstream names on
#      Debian-style CFWs (libmali-bifrost-g31-*.so), an unversioned libmali.so.1
#      on Buildroot ones, libMali.so where a firmware symlinks it.
#   4. No Mali anything, but a real 32-bit EGL/GLES set - a Mesa/glvnd userland,
#      which is what a Panfrost-only device ships. Each entry point is linked
#      under its own name; only GL names are exposed, so nothing else in a
#      system library directory can shadow the port's bundled libs.
#   5. None of those. Say so on screen instead of leaving the user with a black
#      panel: without a 32-bit provider SDL either falls back to something that
#      never reaches the framebuffer, or fails to create a window at all.
#
# Why the wrapper set sits between the two blob tiers, and not elsewhere:
#
#   - It must come after tier 1 so that every device already working keeps
#      working unchanged. A Debian-style CFW that ships the tested blob usually
#      also ships unversioned libEGL.so/libGLESv2.so symlinks beside it; if the
#      wrapper tier ran first it would win there and change a happy path for no
#      reason. Tier 1 matches three literal filenames, so it is cheap to keep in
#      front.
#   - It must come before tier 3, and that is the whole fix. A Knulli device has
#      /usr/lib32/libmali.so.0 next to the wrapper set: the glob tier picks the
#      blob, the preflight can even pass on it, and SDL still dies in
#      SDL_CreateWindow. The wrapper set is the stack that firmware actually
#      supports, so it has to be asked for first. A Knulli Gladiator user got
#      this port running by hand-exporting exactly those two paths.
#
# The discriminator for tier 2 is the *unversioned* pair libEGL.so +
# libGLESv2.so, present together in one directory. A runtime Mesa/glvnd rootfs
# ships only the versioned sonames (libEGL.so.1, libGLESv2.so.2); the
# unversioned names are how the split Mali wrapper installs itself, and they are
# the exact paths the Knulli user hand-edited into a working launcher. Matching
# on them keeps tier 4 for Mesa, where it belongs.
#
# The directories searched are GL_DIRS, set with the system survey at the top of
# this script. They are architecture-scoped, so a 64-bit library can never be
# picked: the multiarch triplet dir and lib32 are 32-bit by definition, and the
# bare /usr/lib and /lib are only consulted on a pure-armhf rootfs.
#
# A candidate that exists is not a driver that works. On a 64-bit userland the
# 32-bit directories can hold an orphaned blob whose own dependencies were
# never installed: /usr/lib32/libmali.so.0 was picked on a muOS device, SDL
# answered "Can't load EGL/GL library on window creation", and every GL import
# resolved to nil. Existence was checked; loadability was not.
#
# So every candidate is dlopen()ed before it is committed to. The probe is the
# port's own binary (--gl-probe): it is 32-bit, it is already here, and it
# loads the library the same way SDL will, in the same runtime linker and the
# same LD_LIBRARY_PATH. ldd would have been simpler and would have been wrong
# on exactly the devices this is for - it execs the host's interpreter list, so
# on a 64-bit rootfs it reports an armhf .so as "not a dynamic executable" and
# says nothing about its dependencies.
#
# A probe that cannot run at all is not a verdict: the candidate is accepted
# unchecked, which is the behaviour before this check existed.
#
# Acceptance is logged as well as rejection. Silence on the happy path made the
# preflight invisible: a log showing "using Mali blob X" followed by SDL failing
# could equally mean the preflight passed and SDL failed anyway, or that the
# user was running a release with no preflight in it at all.
GL_PROBE_REASON=""
GL_REJECTED=""
GL_FIRST_REASON=""
#
# The symbol the candidate must resolve is a parameter because the tiers below
# ask different questions of different kinds of library: does this provide EGL
# (eglGetDisplay), does it provide GLES 2 (glGetString). A library rejected for
# one symbol may be the right answer for another, so the rejection cache is
# keyed by both.
# Mesa's driver is loaded by glvnd, and this port can hide it from itself.
#
# glvnd dlopens the driver named in /usr/share/glvnd/egl_vendor.d/*.json by
# bare soname, so that dlopen walks LD_LIBRARY_PATH - where this port puts its
# own bundled libraries first. Those are built against an old glibc on purpose,
# and a firmware whose Mesa is newer needs symbols they do not carry: on a
# ROCKNIX RG DS, libgallium asked for GLIBCXX_3.4.29 and the bundled libstdc++
# stops at 3.4.28. glvnd discards a vendor whose dlopen fails WITHOUT LOGGING
# IT, so the whole thing surfaces three layers up as eglGetDisplay ->
# EGL_NO_DISPLAY with EGL_BAD_PARAMETER - which reads like a broken EGL and is
# really this port's own search path.
#
# Decided by capability, never by name: try the driver as things stand, and
# only if it fails let the firmware's own copies of the shadowed libraries win
# (the shim directory is already ahead of libs.armhf), then try again. If that
# does not help either, put everything back - a firmware whose libraries are
# OLDER than the bundled set must not be handed them.

# runs a compositor ships exactly that (with its 32-bit DRI drivers named by
# the CFW's own LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH). So: if there is a Wayland socket and a
# Mesa EGL anywhere we search, that pairing outranks every blob tier.

  # all running by exporting SDL_VIDEODRIVER=mali by hand. Upstream SDL has no

  # outright - so this is decided by asking SDL what it has, never by firmware
  # name. On a CFW without it the list simply does not contain "mali" and the
  # default is kept, which is why every device working today stays unchanged.
  #
  # The SDL being asked is the SDL the game will use: libSDL2 is deliberately not
  # bundled (tools/collect_libs.sh leaves it to the device), so this binary and
  # the game both link the system libSDL2-2.0.so.0. See src/sdl_info.h.
